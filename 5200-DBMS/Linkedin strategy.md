## Find the right recruiter
The right recruiter may not be the one connected to hiring manager - but its someone who is willing to help you in any way, give you some guidance in getting a position.

### How to reach out
Things to avoid:
1. being generic
2. spamming
3. being long
4. Asking very open ended questions - not specific
5. Long autobiography

> Key thing is to keep the ball rolling. 
> The is not to get an internship/job. 
> **But instead try to build a relationship**/some rapport/connection to get insight on how to improve resume.

Be intentional and specific.

Hey [Name],
I have an interest and experience with Full stack development. I saw this job  and wanted to see if you would be able to connect me with someone in that department or share a tip to gain visibility to increase my odds. I believe I would be excellent as I have experience with full stack projects, I also bring in the necessary soft skills with my background at Harvard and 3 years of working in a fast paced collaborative company.
