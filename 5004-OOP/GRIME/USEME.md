# Overview

Grime is an image processing application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interactively load, process, and save images. It also supports batch scripting from the command line for advanced users. This document provides a guide on how to use the Grime GUI to perform various image processing operations.

The user can run the program with three types of command line arguments.

1.  `-file {file-path}` : Loads and runs commands from the specified file.
2. `-text` : Scripting Mode. Allows the user to enter commands manually. 
3. ` `(no argument) : GUI Mode. Opens the GUI for the user to interact with.


# GUI Useme

The GUI is divided into three main sections: the toolbar, the image display, and the histogram display. The toolbar contains the menu bar, which allows the user to load and save images, and perform image processing operations. The image display shows the current image, and the histogram display shows the histogram of the current image. The histogram display is updated in real time as the user modifies the image.
