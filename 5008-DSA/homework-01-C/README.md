How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)? 
**03 hours**

Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.  
- one per row, add more if needed
   **None**


Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)  
- one row per resource
   **Online articles to understand github and SSH**

(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment?
   **Learning to set up github and learning to use the command line,**
   **I was waiting to learn that since a long time!**

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 

## Learning Questions

* In C, do you use printf or print? 
   **printf**

* What operating system do you use? 
   **Linux - Fedora**

* What did you end up doing to get C working on your system?
   **installed clang package to be able to compile the code and used CLION as an IDE.**

* Markdown is a common standard to format text, particularly due to the popularity of github. Take a moment to review a github guide or two, and then write a few basic examples of markdown in the 'markdown playground' section below. You need to include both code and some formatting content on the examples. Make sure to view this readme in browser (your github repo) to see how it renders. 

* Computer science ends up becoming more "exploration" based as you progress. This assignment required a lot of exploration and learning the correct thing to setup / install - which is all unique based on your systems. This is common in the industry, even if it can be frustrating for a student just learning. 
   * Reflect a bit on why that would be the case for computer science? Include in your reflection some "habits" you can develop to help better that process of exploration and learning. Please include at least a paragraph for this reflection.

      1. Enjoy the struggle, enjoy learning, make it a part of lifestyle: Embracing the challenges and uncertainties in computer science can be a positive mindset to adopt.Treat learning as a lifelong journey and make it a part of your daily life. Engage in activities like reading technical blogs, experimenting with new technologies, and participating in coding challenges to continually expand your knowledge and skills.
      2. Defining the problem more clearly: Before diving into exploration and learning, take the time to define the problem or task at hand. Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems and identify the core components that need to be addressed. By having a clear understanding of the problem, you can narrow down your exploration and learning to the specific areas that are relevant.
      3. Looking at different approaches before deciding on one solution: In computer science, there are often multiple ways to approach a problem. Instead of settling for the first solution that comes to mind, explore different approaches and evaluate their pros and cons. By considering various options and perspectives, you can make informed decisions and choose the most suitable solution for your specific context.
