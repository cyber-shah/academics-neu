How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)? 
>10

Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.  
- one per row, add more if needed
> Abhijeet Chowdhury


Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)  
- one row per resource
>MIT open courseware


(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
>implementing stacks using linkedlists

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 
> nothing. it was great!

## Further Thinking Questions

1. What are some cases you would use a stack?
> - Undo/ Redo operations 
> - History
> - Function Call Stack
2. What are some cases you would use a queue?
> - ToDo lists
> - Message Queues
> - Office Hours!
3. Why is a linked list useful for implementing a stack? In your reply, consider if a stack was implemented with an array, and the values kept getting added to the front of the area, what would you have to do?
> If we use an array and kept adding elements at the front, we would have to shift all the elements to the right by one position. This would be very expensive. Using a linked list, we can just add the element at the front and change the head pointer. This is much more efficient. 
4. Adding to the end of a singly linked list is expensive, because you have to cycle through the whole list. What is one thing you could change that would make adding to the end just as easy as adding to the front?
> Add a 'TAIL' field
5. Thinking about memory, what is the difference between an array and a linked list? What is the advantage of each?
> - Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations. Linked lists are stored in non-contiguous memory locations.
> - Arrays are faster to access. Linked lists are slower to access.
> - Arrays are fixed in size. Linked lists are dynamic in size.
> - Arrays are expensive to insert and delete. Linked lists are cheap to insert and delete.



## Reflection

There is a ton of research directly relating reflection to performance in Computer Science. The research has even gone as far as to show that reflection helps with job interviews and future promotions. Every few homeworks (and the midterm) we are going to have you write a reflection. When you write a reflection, you should focus on these key points (it should be a few paragraphs). DO NOT just bullet point your answer! This is counter productive! Instead, construct your answer into a proper paragraphs. 

1. Write a brief summary of the key learning points from this class, what you learned, both in and out of class.
> I was introduced to DSA before this class, when I started implementing them in this class, I realize I know a lot more now!
One thing I enjoyed the most in the past few weeks is how better I have become with pointers. When I first came across it, it was very confusing! 
But with some practicing in this class I have become quite comfortable with it, to a degree I never expected I would be. 
Now that I know what the computer was hiding under the hood when I created arrays, lists, etc. I can't wait to learn more data structures and implement them in my future projects!
2. Discuss how you feel about the usefulness and challenges in this class.
   * What was challenging for you?
   > The initial weeks of the course were quite challenging for me. As someone who was new to C programming, I had to invest a significant amount of time in grasping the fundamentals. Understanding concepts like pointers, memory management, and data structures was particularly demanding. However, I dedicated myself to studying and practicing consistently, which has paid off in terms of increased confidence in my programming skills. Overcoming these challenges has been a valuable learning experience.
   * What did you enjoy the most?
   > One aspect of the course that I thoroughly enjoyed was the opportunity to submit assignments multiple times until I got them right. This approach of iterative learning without the pressure of grades allowed me to focus on understanding the concepts and improving my skills. It created a supportive learning environment where I could experiment, learn from my mistakes, and iterate on my solutions. I wish more courses followed this approach!
   * Can you apply your learning directly now or in the future?
   > This newfound understanding has already proved beneficial as I have started actively participating in coding challenges on platforms like LeetCode. I can now approach problems with more confidence, dissect them effectively, and implement solutions using my improved programming skills. I believe this learning will continue to serve me well in future programming endeavors, allowing me to tackle more complex projects and contribute meaningfully to software development.
3. Discuss how you can make future experiences in this area even more valuable. What are your social, personal and intellectual goals in this area?
   * How can you further expand upon your skills?
   > I plan to continue practicing and learning more about data structures and algorithms. I will also explore other programming languages and frameworks to expand my skillset. I will continue to participate in coding challenges and work on personal projects to apply my learning and improve my skills.
   * What do you need to do to improve study habits?
   > I will continue to dedicate time to studying and practicing programming. I will also continue to seek help from my peers and instructors when I encounter challenges. I will also continue to reflect on my learning and identify areas for improvement.
   * What areas do you need to work specifically related to coding?
   > I will continue to work on my coding skills by practicing and participating in coding challenges. I will also continue to work on my problem-solving skills by dissecting problems and identifying the most efficient solutions. One major thing I would look up to is thinking through different solutions before implementing one.

For this reflection, we encourage you to focus on challenges, study habits, and ways you can improve.
