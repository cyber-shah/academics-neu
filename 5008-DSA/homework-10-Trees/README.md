## BST Questions

1. Given a *balanced* and *full* Binary Search Tree, what is the Big O for finding a value in the tree?
   
> Finding value for a balanced tree
> * Worst case Time Complexity: O(log n)
> * Best case Time Complexity: O(1)
> * Average case Time Complexity: O(log n)

2. Define balanced in relation to BSTs. Remember to relate it to height. 

> A balanced tree is a tree where the difference between the heights of left subtree and right subtree of every node is not more than 1.


3. What is the Worst Case Big O for searching or adding to a BST?
   * What type of BST would this be? (how would it look)

> This would be a tree similar to a linked list, with all the nodes on one side of the tree. 
The worst case Big O for searching or adding to a BST with nodes on only one side is O(n).

4. What are some of the advantages of a BST over a linked list?

> The advantage of BST over a linked list is that we can find and insert elements in O(Log n) time.
Whereas in linked list it takes O(n) time. 

5. What are some cases / examples of when you would use a BST?

> I would use BSTs whenever I would need fast insertion and find operations.
The best example that I can think of is a phonebook where we can search for a person's name in O(log n) time.
This was best explained by Professor David Malan in the CS50 course!
