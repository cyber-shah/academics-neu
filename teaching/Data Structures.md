Abstraction is something that almost everyone practices, but that many people are not consciously aware of or able to define. By examining a specific example of this paradox, we can help students understand what abstraction is, and appreciate its importance. Our current favorite example is the cellular telephone: a cell phone is “really” a sophisticated computer on an elaborate wireless network. Users of cell phones don’t think of them this way, however; users think of cell phones as relatively simple variations on the familiar telephone. This is an act of abstraction, allowing users to ignore the details of analog-to-digital conversion, network connection, radio modulation, etc., in order to “simply” place a call.

To show this abstraction to students, the instructor can offer to trade cell phones with a student, with one of the parties then placing a call to the other. Since each person is using an unfamiliar phone, it’s reasonable for each person to explain to the other how to place or answer a call with their phone. The explanation will almost certainly be in terms such as “push such and such a button,” “dial the number,” etc.

After successfully placing the call, the instructor can say a little bit about how cell phones work, and explain placing and answering a call in terms of what “really” happens — to place a call, you make the computer in the calling phone tell the radio transmitter to modulate its signal in a way that encodes a packet of data that initiates the call…. The point that this process was previously described in very different, much simpler, terms, and that no-one who really wanted to use a cell phone would use the “real” description, can be made very quickly, without requiring the instructor to know much about cellular technology. Indeed, just reciting the above sentence “you make the computer in the calling phone tell the radio transmitter to modulate its signal in a way that encodes a packet of data that initiates the call…” can be enough to establish the basic point. For instructors who want to know more about cellular technology, textbooks on wireless networking provide an ample introduction. Once students have seen the difference between how they think of cell phones and what happens internally, the instructor can say a few words about the difference as an example of abstraction: the way people usually think of their phones hides details that ordinary users don’t need to know (i.e., it’s abstraction), and indeed hides details that would make cell phones unusable if users did have to know them (i.e., abstraction is essential to working with technological systems).
